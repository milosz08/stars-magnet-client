# Stars Magnet Client

> More info about this project you will find [on my personal website](https://miloszgilga.pl/project/stars-magnet-client)

Client for [Stars Magnet](https://github.com/Lettulouz/StarsMagnet) Django rest API. This application allows you to register/log in and create
new company accounts. Each company can be rated only once by a logged-in user (this rating is included in the average). Based on these values,
it is possible to filter companies with the highest level of trust. The company also has the option to respond to comments.

I didn't have much influence on the business solutions in the application. My task was only to create the visual layer. To a lesser extent,
I made improvements to the server and was in constant contact with the backend developers.
